# Linear Regression Project

This project is part of an analysis for an E-commerce company based in New York City. The company offers both in-store and online services for clothing shopping. The goal of this project is to help the company decide where to focus their efforts - on their mobile app or website. The dataset contains various customer metrics, such as session lengths, time spent on the app and website, and length of membership. (P.S The data fake.)

## Data Exploration

The analysis begins with an exploration of the dataset. We start by visualizing relationships between different features to gain insights into the data. This includes scatter plots, joint plots, and pair plots. These visualizations help us understand how different factors are correlated with each other.

## Correlation Analysis

We investigate the correlation between the time spent on the website and the yearly amount spent by customers. Similarly, we analyze the correlation between time spent on the mobile app and yearly spending. These correlations provide valuable insights into customer behavior.

## Linear Model

A linear regression model is constructed to predict yearly spending based on various customer metrics. The data is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training data. The linear regression model is implemented using the scikit-learn library.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the model is assessed using various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics quantify the accuracy of the model's predictions.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the coefficients obtained from the linear regression model, we can make recommendations to the company. For instance, we find that an increase in length of membership has the highest impact on yearly spending. This suggests that efforts should be focused on retaining customers and encouraging long-term memberships.
